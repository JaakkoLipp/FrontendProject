        <p>"Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones, and innocent people get arrested every day. And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend. 'Talk to me,' he says. Uh, 'help me clear this thing up.</p>
        <p>You don't need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers.' And boom! Hey, that's when it all goes south. That's when you want someone in your corner, someone who will fight tooth and nail. Lawyers, you know, we're like health insurance. You hope you never need it. But, man, oh, man, not having it, no."</p>
